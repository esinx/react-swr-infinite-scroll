# SWR Infinite Scroll

[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

> An easier way to `useSWRInfinite`

SWR provides an amazing way to manage paged data through `useSWRInfinite`. But it's not as intuitive when it comes to implementing infinite scroll itself. `react-swr-infinite-scroll` attempts to solve this by implementing it for you. Using the `IntersectionObserver` API, it detects whether the viewport has reached the _end of the list view_ to decide if the data has to be reloaded.

## Demo

Visit the demo storybook [here](https://react-swr-infinite-scroll.vercel.app/).

## Features

- Seamless useSWRInfinite integration
- Awesome TypeScript completion
- InfiniteScroll (of course)
- Horizontal InfiniteScroll
- Customizable loading & ending indicator
- Customizable triggering behavior (offset)

## Installation

```shell
yarn add react-swr-infinite-scroll
```
or
```shell
npm install --save react-swr-infinite-scroll
```

## Usage

> tldr; You will still `useSWRInfinite`, while the state management is done by the `InfiniteScroll` component in the render

What you'll need to implement/know:
- Some way to **load paged data**
- Some way to load the **next paged data**
- Some way to **detect** that the paged data is **reaching its end**
- Some way to **render** the list of paged data

```jsx
const Component: React.FC = () => {
    const swr = useSWRInfinite(/* implement SWR here*/)
    return <InfiniteScroll
                swr={swr}
                loadingIndicator="Loading..."
                isReachingEnd={/* implement ending detection here */}>
        {response => /* implement render here */}
    </InfiniteScroll>
}
```

### Props

```typescript
type Props<T> = {
  swr: SWRInfiniteResponse<T>;
  children: React.ReactChild | ((item: T) => React.ReactNode);
  loadingIndicator?: React.ReactNode;
  endingIndicator?: React.ReactNode;
  isReachingEnd: boolean | ((swr: SWRInfiniteResponse<T>) => boolean);
  offset?: number;
};
```

- `swr`: pass your `useSWRInfinite` hook here
- `children`: could either be a regular react child that uses the data from the original swr object itself, or a function that renders the list items passed from the `InfiniteScroll` component
- `isReachingEnd`: A function / boolean value to tell if the list is reaching its end (see examples for a better idea of how `isReachingEnd` should be implemented)
- (optional) `loadingIndicator`: A react node to be displayed when the list is loading
- (optional) `endingIndicator`: A react node to be displayed when the list is reaching its end
- (optional) `offset`
  - if set to a positive value, the reload trigger will be called when the end of the list is behind the viewport
  - if set to a negative value, the reload trigger will be called when the end of the list is ahead of the viewport

## Examples

### GitHub Issues

Borrowed from [this example](https://swr.vercel.app/examples/infinite-loading) by SWR

```jsx

const PAGE_SIZE = 5;

export const GitHub: React.FC = () => {

  const swr = useSWRInfinite(
    (index, prev) =>
      `https://api.github.com/repos/reactjs/react-a11y/issues?per_page=${PAGE_SIZE}&page=${
        index + 1
      }`,
    {
      fetcher: async (key) => fetch(key).then((res) => res.json()),
    }
  );

  return (
      <div style={{ maxWidth: '400px'}}>
        <InfiniteScroll
          swr={swr}
          loadingIndicator="Loading..."
          endingIndicator="No more issues! ðŸŽ‰"
          isReachingEnd={(swr) =>
            swr.data?.[0]?.length === 0 || swr.data?.[swr.data?.length - 1]?.length < PAGE_SIZE
          }
        >
          {(response) =>
            response?.map((issue) => (
              <div
                key={issue.id}
                style={{
                  padding: '20px',
                  borderRadius: '8px',
                  border: 'solid #ccc 1px',
                  margin: '20px auto',
                }}
              >
                <div style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>{issue.title}</div>
                <div style={{ color: '#aaa', marginTop: '8px' }}>
                  {issue.user.login} â€¢ {new Date(issue.created_at).toDateString()}
                </div>
              </div>
            ))
          }
        </InfiniteScroll>
    </div>
  );
};
```
